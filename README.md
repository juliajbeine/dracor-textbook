# DraCor Textbook

The DraCor Textbook is a curated, pedagogically structured Open Educational Resource (OER) developed by the DraCorOS team. It complements (rather than replaces) the community-driven DraCor Notebooks by offering a coherent learning path for working with DraCor’s programmable drama corpora.

The textbook is published as a Jupyter Book website (GitHub Pages) and is under active development.
